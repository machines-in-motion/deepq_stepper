# This folder contains steppers for 0.2 seconds step time

1) dqs_x11 : stepper trained for 1d case in the x direction with 11 actions and 0.2 max step length
2) dqs_x5 : same as above for 5 actions
3) dqs_y9 : trained with stepper in 1d case in y direcion (contains hip offset of 0.13 like bolt). 9 actions, max step length 0.2

4) dqs_11_9 : trained with warm started dqs_x11 and dqs_y9. epsilon 0.8 starting. 
5) dqs_1_old : trained like dqs_11_9 but with epsillon 0.7.
6) dqs_1 : used (dqs_1_old) procedure and then started training with epsillon greedy for 2000 episodes (this helped seeing bad actions as well.)
