# This folder contains steppers for 0.2 seconds step time

# Trained in ipm

1) dqs_x11 : stepper trained for 1d case in the x direction with 11 actions and 0.2 max step length
2) dqs_x5 : same as above for 5 actions
3) dqs_y9 : trained with stepper in 1d case in y direcion (contains hip offset of 0.13 like bolt). 9 actions, max step length 0.2

4) dqs_11_9 : trained with warm started dqs_x11 and dqs_y9. epsilon 0.8 starting. Then reduced epsilon to 0.2 and 
                did epsillon greedy to make sure it sees enough bad states. 

# Trained in Bullet directly

5) dqs_1_wm : trained like dqs_11_9 but with epsillon 0.8 for buffer. then epsillon reduced to 0.5. After 5000 iterations
                reduce by half every 1000 episodes. (Used dqs_x11, dqs_y9)
6) dqs_1_vel : used dqs_1_wm weights and with epsilon greedy (0.1) to train for tracking velocities.
